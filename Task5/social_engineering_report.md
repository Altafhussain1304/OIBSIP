Task 5 — Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks





1\. Introduction

Social engineering is a type of cyberattack that targets people rather than systems. Instead of hacking through code, attackers use psychological tricks to get individuals to reveal sensitive information or perform unsafe actions. These attacks rely on emotions like trust, fear, or curiosity — not technical vulnerabilities.



2\. Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

Phishing

Attackers send fake emails or messages that look real — often pretending to be from banks, IT teams, or popular services. The goal is to make the victim click a link, download a file, or enter login details. Impact: Stolen credentials, malware infections, and financial loss.



Spear Phishing

This is a more targeted version of phishing. The attacker researches the victim and crafts a personalized message that feels legitimate. Impact: High success rate, especially against people with access to sensitive systems.



Business Email Compromise (BEC) / CEO Fraud

Here, attackers impersonate company executives or vendors to trick employees into transferring money or sharing confidential data. Impact: Major financial damage and loss of trust.



Pretexting

The attacker creates a believable story — like pretending to be tech support — to convince someone to share private info or perform actions. Impact: Unauthorized access and data leaks.



Baiting

This involves leaving a tempting item (like a USB labeled “Salary Info”) in a public place. When someone plugs it in, malware gets installed. Impact: System compromise and data theft.



Tailgating / Piggybacking

A physical tactic where someone sneaks into a secure area by following an authorized person — often by asking them to hold the door. Impact: Physical access to systems and potential on-site threats.



3\. How These Attacks Play Out

A phishing email might say “Your account is locked — click here to reset your password,” leading to a fake login page.



Spear phishing could involve referencing a recent meeting or project to make the email seem authentic.



In BEC, a finance employee might get an urgent email from a “CEO” asking for a wire transfer.



Baiting works when someone plugs in a suspicious USB and unknowingly installs malware.



4\. Real-World Examples

RSA SecurID breach: Attackers used spear-phishing emails to deliver malware and steal authentication data.



Target breach: Hackers compromised a third-party vendor via phishing and used their access to install malware on Target’s systems.



BEC cases: Many companies have lost millions due to fake emails from “executives” requesting urgent payments.



5\. Why These Attacks Work

People trust familiar names and brands.



Urgent messages push quick decisions.



Authority figures (like managers) are rarely questioned.



Curiosity or greed can lead to risky clicks.



Lack of training means users don’t recognize warning signs.



6\. How to Prevent Social Engineering

Technical Defenses

Use email filters and anti-phishing tools.



Set up SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to prevent spoofing.



Install endpoint protection software.



Limit access using network segmentation and least privilege.



Administrative Defenses

Run regular awareness training and phishing simulations.



Verify financial requests with phone calls and multi-person approval.



Review third-party vendor security practices.



Physical Defenses

Enforce badge checks and anti-tailgating systems.



Properly dispose of sensitive documents and control USB usage.



7\. Defensive Playbook

Always verify fund transfer requests with a phone call and manager approval.



Report suspicious login pages and check email headers.



After phishing simulations, follow up with targeted training for those who clicked.



8\. Conclusion

Social engineering attacks are dangerous because they target human behavior. The best defense is a mix of technical tools, strong policies, and continuous user education. Organizations must treat this as an ongoing challenge — not a one-time fix.
