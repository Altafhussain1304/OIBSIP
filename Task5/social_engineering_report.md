# Task 5 — Research Report on Social Engineering Attacks


---

## 1. Introduction  
Social engineering is a technique used by attackers to manipulate people into giving away confidential information or performing actions that compromise security. Unlike technical hacks, these attacks rely on human psychology — such as trust, urgency, or curiosity — to succeed.

## 2. Common Types of Social Engineering Attacks

### Phishing  
Attackers send fake emails or messages that appear to come from trusted sources. These messages often contain malicious links or attachments.  
**Impact:** Stolen credentials, malware infections, financial loss.

### Spear Phishing  
A more targeted version of phishing. The attacker uses personal information to craft convincing messages aimed at specific individuals.  
**Impact:** High success rate, especially against executives or privileged users.

### Business Email Compromise (BEC) / CEO Fraud  
Attackers impersonate company executives or vendors to trick employees into transferring money or sharing sensitive data.  
**Impact:** Major financial losses and reputational damage.

### Pretexting  
The attacker creates a believable scenario (pretext) to trick someone into revealing information or performing an action.  
**Impact:** Unauthorized access, data leaks.

### Baiting  
Malicious devices (like USB drives labeled “Confidential”) are left in public places. When plugged in, they install malware.  
**Impact:** System compromise, data theft.

### Tailgating / Piggybacking  
An attacker physically follows an authorized person into a restricted area by pretending to have forgotten their badge.  
**Impact:** Physical access to secure systems or data.

## 3. How These Attacks Work — Simple Examples

- **Phishing:** A fake email from “IT Support” asks the user to reset their password via a malicious link.  
- **Spear Phishing:** An attacker references a recent project in an email to make it look legitimate.  
- **BEC:** A finance employee receives an urgent email from a “CEO” requesting a wire transfer.  
- **Baiting:** A USB labeled “Salary Info” is plugged in, installing a backdoor on the system.

## 4. Real-World Case Studies

- **RSA SecurID Breach:** Spear-phishing emails delivered malware that led to the theft of sensitive authentication data.  
- **Target Breach:** Attackers compromised a third-party vendor via phishing and used their access to install malware on Target’s systems.  
- **BEC Incidents:** Many companies have lost millions due to attackers impersonating executives or suppliers using spoofed emails.

## 5. Why Social Engineering Works

- **Trust:** People tend to trust familiar names and brands.  
- **Urgency:** Messages that create pressure lead to rushed decisions.  
- **Authority:** Requests from “higher-ups” are rarely questioned.  
- **Curiosity/Greed:** Tempting offers or files can override caution.  
- **Lack of Awareness:** Many users don’t recognize the signs of a scam.

## 6. Preventive Measures

### Technical  
- Use email filters and anti-phishing tools  
- Implement SPF, DKIM, and DMARC  
- Deploy endpoint protection and EDR  
- Segment networks and apply least privilege

### Administrative  
- Conduct regular user training and phishing simulations  
- Require multi-step verification for financial transactions  
- Review vendor access and security practices

### Physical  
- Enforce badge access and anti-tailgating systems  
- Secure disposal of sensitive documents and media

## 7. Defensive Playbook (Quick Steps)

1. Always verify fund transfer requests with a phone call and manager approval.  
2. Report suspicious emails and check domain reputation.  
3. Provide follow-up training to users who fall for phishing simulations.

## 8. Conclusion  
Social engineering remains one of the most effective attack methods because it targets human behavior. A strong defense requires a mix of technical controls, user education, and strict verification processes.
